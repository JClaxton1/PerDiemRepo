/**
 *  A _Condition_ is the smallest sub element of the validation framework.
 *  It tells how a string must be structured or wat is has to contain or not.
 *  Validators are for storing those conditions and checking
 *  for violations of every condition.
 *
 *  Conditions are recommended working with regular expressions but can also contain
 *  their custom checking code for detecting violations in the string to check.
 *
 *  By returning a localized string in method `localizedViolationString` the
 *  user can be informed in a convenient way what went wrong.
